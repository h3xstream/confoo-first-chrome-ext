# Why develop a Chrome extension?

**Technical reasons**

 - You can use your favorite Frontend framework (Vue, React, Angular, ...)
 - A great addition to an existing CLI
    - It can share code with other JS projects.
 - Lighter than yet another Electron application

## Webpack fallback

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      assert: require.resolve('assert'),
      buffer: require.resolve('buffer'),
      console: require.resolve('console-browserify'),
      constants: require.resolve('constants-browserify'),
      crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
      domain: require.resolve('domain-browser'),
      events: require.resolve('events'),
      http: require.resolve('stream-http'),
  //...
```
